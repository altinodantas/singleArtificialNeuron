# Single Artificial Neuron

is a webpage that presents some animated charts for basic examples of Perceptron, Adaline and Descendant Gradient procedure.

For Perceptron and Adaline examples, the initial values of weights (W) and bias are randomly generated and updated according to the selected algorithm.

## Perceptron
This page presents a visual example of a single artificial neuron fiting over the logical port 'AND'. 
One can check how the Perceptron works to separate the output in "0" and "1".

## Adaline
This page presents a visual example of a single artificial neuron fiting over the logical port 'AND'. 
One can check how the Perceptron works to separate the output in "0" and "1".

## Gradient
Gradient Descendant is usually applied to guide the adjustment of the synaptic weights in artificial neural networks.

This page presents a visual example on how Descendant Gradient works in finding minimal values to f(x) = x4 - 3x3 + 2.
You can choice a start point by hitting at the graph or clicking in 'Random x' button.
